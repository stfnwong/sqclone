# SQLITE CLONE 
This is a clone of SQLite3 in C. I am following along from here (https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/), so its not really my own original work.



# Requirements 
- Unit tests use [bdd-for-c](https://github.com/grassator/bdd-for-c). The header file is included in the test directory. `bdd-for-c` requires libncurses 5.x and libbsd.
